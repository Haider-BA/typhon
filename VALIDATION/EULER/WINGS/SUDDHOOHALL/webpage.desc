TITLE: Inviscid flow over multi-element airfoil (Suddhoo-Hall)
NAME: Suddhoo-Hall
SECTION: Airfoils
KEYWORDS: Low-Speed 2D Inviscid Airfoils
DESCR:<p>This inviscid flow on a multi-element airfoil is interesting
DESCR:since this geometry has been defined through a conformal transformation
DESCR:of four cylinders. Thus, a theoretical solution can be computed.</p>
