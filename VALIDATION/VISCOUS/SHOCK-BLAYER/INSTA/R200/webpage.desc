TITLE: Shock-Boundary layer interaction in shock tube (Reynolds 200)
NAME: ShockTube-R200
SECTION: viscous
KEYWORDS: Shock-Waves 2D Viscous Unsteady
DESCR:<p>This is an unsteady viscous computation of a shock tube problem
DESCR:in a closed 1x1 box. The initial conditions are set with two gases at
DESCR:rest, same temperature but pressure and density ratio of 100 
DESCR:(left over right values). The Reynolds number (200) is based on the initial speed 
DESCR:of sound and the box length. This test case has been proposed by 
DESCR:Daru and Tenaud.</p>
DESCR:<p>Due to the initial pressure discontinuity, a shock wave travels from
DESCR:left to right while accelerating the flow and creating a boundary layer on the
DESCR:bottom wall. Then the shock hits the right wall, crosses the initial gas interface
DESCR:and travels back to the left. The shock wave makes the boundary layer separate into
DESCR:a complex vortical flow.</p>
